## 💡 Concept

A.R.I. is designed for those who want **hands-on practice** rather than just reading theory.  
Each level gradually increases in difficulty, from quizzes with a single attempt to live coding challenges with multiple tries.  
After an incorrect answer (in Levels 2–5), the **correct solution is shown**, allowing players to analyze mistakes, learn, and remember the right answer.  
The game tracks your progress and shows **end-of-game statistics**, helping you learn efficiently and stay motivated.
