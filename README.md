💡 Concept

A.R.I. is designed for those who want hands-on practice rather than just reading theory.
Each level gradually increases in difficulty, from quizzes with a single attempt to live coding challenges with multiple tries.
After an incorrect answer (in Levels 2–5), the correct solution is shown, allowing players to analyze mistakes, learn, and remember the right answer.
The game tracks your progress and shows end-of-game statistics, helping you learn efficiently and stay motivated.
